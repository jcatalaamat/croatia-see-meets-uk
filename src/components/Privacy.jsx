        <b>How we collect and use information</b>
        <br />
        <br />

We may collect and process data about you for the following reasons:
        <br />
        <br />
Visitors to the website – if you visit our websites or landing pages we, the third party that runs the website on our behalf, and a third-party analytics service, may collect information relating to your visit including, but not limited to, traffic data, location data, weblogs and other communication data, and the resources that you access. The analytics information is only processed in a way which does not identify anyone. We do not make, and do not allow the analytics service provider to make, any attempt to find out the identities of those visiting our website. Please also see our Terms and Conditions and our Cookies Disclaimer for further information about the use of the website.
        <br />
        <br />
Persons booking events with the British Croatian Chamber of Commerce – if you book an event with BCCC then we will hold any personal data that is collected as part of the booking process, such as name, email address, telephone address and other contact details. We will process personal financial data if you make payments from a personal account (rather than a business account). If payment is taken using a personal credit or debit card, then our bank(s), the provider(s) of the card payment device, will also process your data. We may also receive personal data about you or your guests if you provide any in the context of the event. Should you provide us with personal data on individuals other than yourself, you confirm that you have their consent to do so. Correspondence and booking information in respect of your event will be retained for up to two years after your event for accounting purposes and to address any queries that arise following your event. After this time your personal data will be deleted, unless (i) it is required for a legal reason, or (ii) you have requested to receive information about future BCCC events, in which case we will retain your contact information, which will be used only for this purpose.
        <br />
        <br />
If you do join our mailing list and subsequently decide that you would like to be removed, you can unsubscribe by emailing us at events@britishcroatian.co.uk or members@britishcroatiancc.co.uk.
        <br />
        <br />
People we do business with – we hold personal data in respect of persons with whom we have business relationships, or potential business relationships. This data is typically limited to basic personal information such as name, email address, telephone number, as well as details related to the nature of the business relationship. Information is processed in accordance with any contractual agreement in place or in the legitimate interests of our business activities.
        <br />
        <br />
Our staff – we hold personal data in respect of our employees, directors, contractors and other persons who work with us from time-to-time. We have a separate privacy policy for our staff. If a person wishing to work with us sends us their details, for example through a recruitment process, we will do our best to gain their consent to hold onto their details for future roles with us, or, we will aim to delete the records once the recruitment process has concluded, although it may not be possible to remove all personal details; for example, it may not be possible to remove all references to a person’s name in our internal email system.

        <br />
        <b>Lawful basis for processing</b>
        <br />
        <br />

Under the GDPR there must be a lawful basis for processing your personal data. As outlined above, we will only do so for the purpose of running our business, to provide information to you that you request from us relating to our products or services, to fulfil contractual obligations, or to provide information to interested parties making reasonable enquiries. In terms of the GDPR, we will be processing either on the lawful basis of fulfilling a contractual obligation, or the lawful basis of being in the legitimate interests of our business or customers. Finally, we may process on the lawful basis of fulfilling a legal obligation if this is applicable.
        <br />
        <br />
We also process your personal data on the lawful basis of consent where you have opted to receive information about future events at BCCC. You may withdraw this consent at any time by unsubscribing from our mailing list as described above. We do not ever sell or pass personal data to third parties for marketing purposes.
        <br />
        <br />
Finally, we also rely on the lawful basis of consent if you apply for a job at BCCC and agree for us to retain your details for potential future positions.
        <br />
        <br />
We never give your details to third parties to use your data to enable them to provide you with information regarding unrelated goods or services.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
        <b>Who we do share information with</b>
        <br />
        <br />

We will only share your personal data with other third parties where it is necessary for the purposes outlined above and in accordance with the relevant lawful basis for processing. Examples of the third parties that may process personal data on our behalf are: suppliers that you agree will be part of your event at BCCC, our professional advisers, our auditors, the companies that help us administer this website and any payment taken on it, organisations that provide other services that are required in the provision of our services to you. Third parties that process data on our behalf are also subject to all of the requirements of the GDPR and owe us a contractual obligation to only use your personal data for the applicable purpose and to keep your data secure.
        <br />
        <br />
We may also disclose your personal information to any member of our group, which means our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company and its subsidiaries, as defined in section 1159 of the UK Companies Act 2006.
        <br />
        <br />
We may disclose your personal information to third parties if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply our terms of use and other agreements; or to protect our rights, property, or the safety of our staff, customers, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
        <br />
        <br />
Finally, in the event that we sell or buy any business or assets, we may disclose personal data to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets. If we are acquired by a third party, personal data will be one of the transferred assets.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
        <b>How information is kept secure</b>
        <br />
        <br />

We take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy. Where personal data is held electronically we store information on our secure servers and employ security procedures and features to try to prevent unauthorised access.
        <br />
        <br />
Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect personal data in our possession, we cannot guarantee the security of data when being transmitted; any transmission of your personal data to us at our site or via email or other transmission method is at your own risk.
        <br />
        <br />
On occasion we include links to third parties on this website. Where we provide a link it does not mean that we endorse or approve that site’s policy towards visitor privacy. You should review their privacy policy before sending them any personal data.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Transfers of data outside of the EEA</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />

Personal data that we collect from you will only be transferred to or stored at a destination outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers if the organisation or country has data protection measures that have been deemed equivalent to those in the EEA or if we have put adequate safeguards in place to ensure equivalent treatment of your personal data. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing for the purpose indicated, provided one of the conditions above is met.
      </p>
